The database tier in the initial estimates was the most expensive one. It was a multi-az deploy with a read-replica also. This deployment architecture provided a High Availability configuration. However due to reduce cost, the RDS deployment was changed from multi-az to single AZ deployment with read replica. This is not a pure HA configuration. In case of an outage, manual intervention is needed to promote the read replica to an instance and DNS switched to reroute all write operations to the newly promoted RDS instance. Due to this deployment design, the cost went down below $6500 per month.
