Since the monthly budget has been increased, we can now plan for performance and redundancy. The instance type has been changed from compute to t3 bustable type (t3.2xlarge). Bustable type can use of CPU credits accumulated during non peak hours and use them during peak load times. In addition, the number of minimum and maximum instances in the autoscaling groups (combined for web and app servers) has been increased from min 8 to min 12 and max 16 to max 24. This will ensure that we have enough capacity in the frontend and application layers during peak usage. The design also takes into account the regular snapshots (2 times a day) for the EC2 servers. These snapshots will be shared to the DR region for quickly setting up the EC2 instances during DR scenario.

For the database, the deployment is now a multi az deployment. Total 4 nodes have been provisioned. 1 node exclusively for write process & 2 read replicas. The last node will be build in another region for Disaster recorvery scenario. The master node will replicate data to this DR Node. This design ensure that we have high performance for both read and write with high availiblilty. Also in case of DR, we can manually switch over to the DR node for business continuity.
